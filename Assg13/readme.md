According to our milestone, we finished the error behaviors and nominal behaviors.

In our system, we defined a out of data error and authorization error. When the Zigbee devices caused error data and send to the main control router, the out of data error will used to handle this error. Similar, authorization error used when there is authorization issue between clients and remote server, clients and main control router.

Thank you
